<h1> Welcome to my blog</h1>

Okay, here is my frst blog. I started my journey in this bootcamp at February 19th 2018. FIrst of all, I want to tell you that why I decide to enter this bootcamp. I work as an estimator in my company that ran by my father. I've allready work there for almost 2 years and I felt that something should be changed in this company. The System should be all computerized and I want to implemetn my knowledge that I got here to improve the company.
